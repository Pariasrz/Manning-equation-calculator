# Manning-equation-calculator

The Manning equation is a widely used in water resources. It can be used to compute the flow in an open channel, compute the friction losses in a channel, derive the capacity of a pipe, check the performance of an area-velocity flow meter, and has many more applications. The equation is as mentioned below:

Where:

Q = Discharge or Flow Rate (m^3/s)

n = Roughness Coefficient

s = Channel Slope (m/m)

R = Hydraulic Radius (m)

A = Flow Area (m^2)

## Input
The inputs of this program are Q, b, z, s, and n. 

## Output
The outputs are the depth of the channel (m) and the velocity in the channel (m/s). It can also draw the section of the channel.
