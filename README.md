# Manning-equation-calculator

The Manning equation is a widely used in water resources. It can be used to compute the flow in an open channel, compute the friction losses in a channel, derive the capacity of a pipe, check the performance of an area-velocity flow meter, and has many more applications. The equation is as mentioned below:

Where:
Q = Discharge or Flow Rate (m^3/s)
n = Roughness Coefficient
A = Flow Area (m^2)
R = Hydraulic Radius (m)
s = Channel Slope (m/m)
